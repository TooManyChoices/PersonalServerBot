# config.json guide
hello mysterious github wanderer, welcome to this repo. you may have noticed a lot of things mentioning a "config.json" and yet no config.json in sight. well, my dear friend who is dealing with my lack of capitalization, that is because it, like, contains my bot token and stuff, so, i didn't want it here :thumbsup:

you must make the file yourself, and also add it's path as an executable argument when launching the program
here are the keys:
- **token (string)**: y'know, the bot's token.
- **ignore-log-severity (number)**: a lot of logs can appear, luckily they all have a severity level between 0-5. i'd recommend setting this one to 2 when you aren't testing the bot so that the console isn't flooded too badly.

you have to add all of them because i'm too lazy to check if you even have it in the file, sorry >-<
